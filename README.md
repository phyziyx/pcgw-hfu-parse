PCGamingWiki High Fidelity Upscaling games list parser

## Background

Managing the page (https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/List_of_games_that_support_high-fidelity_upscaling) got extremely ugly, and with bunch of new upscaling technologies on the horizon, there was a need of a new format that not only allowed for better readability but also ease of editing/access for all contributors.  I had originally decided to do this earlier but it's better late than never.
